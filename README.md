## Let's begin ! 


### Part 1: JavaScript

#### #Task 1: JavaScript Fundamentals 

1. Write a JavaScript function called `isPrime` that takes an integer as input and returns `true` if it's a prime number, and `false` otherwise.

#### #Task 2: DOM Manipulation and JavaScript Operations 

1. Create an HTML page with a button and an empty div element.
2. Write JavaScript code to add an event listener to the button so that when clicked, it fetches and displays 3 random quotes from the [https://api.quotable.io/random](https://api.quotable.io/random) API within the div.
3. Style the displayed quotes and button using CSS to make them visually appealing.

### Part 2: Advanced CSS Techniques 

#### #Task 3: Responsive Layout and Flexbox 

1. Create an HTML structure for a responsive navigation bar and a content section.
2. Implement a responsive layout using CSS Flexbox so that the navigation bar remains at the top  of the page and the content flows below it when scrolling.
3. Implement a burger menu for navigation items on smaller sceens if needed.
4. Apply styling to make the navigation bar visually appealing.

#### #Task 4: CSS Transitions and Hover Effects 

1. Design a button element on the page.
2. Implement a CSS transition effect that smoothly changes the button's background color and font color when hovered over.
3. Add a subtle shadow effect to the button when it's clicked, and ensure the transition is smooth.

## The rules of the game
- This is a personal test, don't share this page with friends or online
- Make sure that the HTML source is valid (W3C)
- Use CSS, SCSS or Sass for styling, no JS
- Use only pure JS, external frameworks or libraries (e.g. jQuery) are not allowed.
- You don't have to support retired browsers, using the latest ECMA version is allowed!

## What we appreciate
Just like you, we appreciate clean and readable code. We aim for quality and maintainability!
Don't hesisate to make several commits so we can follow the evolutions and your reasoning. (We love conventional commits).
Show us how well you can follow given instructions, have attention to details and how strong and up to date your JS skills are.
